# shortest_path_turn_penalty
Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest weighted paths to one or multiple targets with turn penalty. 
This function is adapted from networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.weighted._dijkstra_multisource.

The turn penalty implementation is based on:  
Ziliaskopoulos, A.K., Mahmassani, H.S., 1996. A note on least time path computation considering delays and prohibitions for intersection movements. Transportation Research Part B: Methodological 30, 359â€“367. https://doi.org/10.1016/0191-2615(96)00001-X
