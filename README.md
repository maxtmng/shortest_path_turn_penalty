# shortest_path_turn_penalty

This project implements a modified Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest weighted paths in a graph while considering turn penalties at intersections. It's particularly useful for routing applications in road networks where turn delays significantly impact travel times.

## Features

- Calculates shortest paths with consideration for turn penalties
- Supports both left and right turn penalties
- Uses OpenStreetMap data for real-world road networks
- Includes utility functions for calculating bearings and identifying turn types

## Algorithm Details

The main function is adapted from `networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.weighted._dijkstra_multisource`. It uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest weighted paths to one or multiple targets with turn penalty.

The turn penalty implementation is based on the work of Ziliaskopoulos and Mahmassani (1996):

Ziliaskopoulos, A.K., Mahmassani, H.S., 1996. A note on least time path computation considering delays and prohibitions for intersection movements. Transportation Research Part B: Methodological 30, 359–367. https://doi.org/10.1016/0191-2615(96)00001-X

## Installation

To use this project, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install networkx osmnx pytest
```

## Usage

The main function `shortest_path_turn_penalty` is located in `shortest_path_turn_penalty.py`. Here's a basic example of how to use it:

```python
import networkx as nx
from shortest_path_util import penalty_turns
from shortest_path_turn_penalty import shortest_path_turn_penalty

# Load or create your graph
G = nx.Graph()  # Replace this with your graph loading logic

# Calculate turn penalties
penalty = penalty_turns(G)

# Find the shortest path
path = shortest_path_turn_penalty(G, source_node, target_node, weight="travel_time", penalty=penalty)
```

## Testing

The project includes a test suite in `test_shortest_path_turn_penalty.py`. To run the tests:

```bash
pytest test_shortest_path_turn_penalty.py
```

The test suite uses a sample road network from OpenStreetMap, which is downloaded and cached locally for subsequent runs.
